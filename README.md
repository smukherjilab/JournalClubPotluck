# Journal Club Potluck

Every other week, biology people in the Physics Department of WUSTL get together and each brings one of their favorite recent papers, introducing briefly for 3~5 minutes. In case someone is interested in others' recommending papers, we collect people's choices and here is this repository.

## What to see?

Papers, trending (record is 4 hours I remember? lol) or classic, in the following fields:

- System biology / synthetic biology
- Evolution and ecology
- Neural science
- Biomechanics
- Other eye-catching ones

## How to follow?

- Watch this repository in `release only` mode

    There may be minor modifications from time to time. In order not to distrupt people's timelines, we will create a new release for every journal club, so that you can watch this repo and select the `release only` mode.
